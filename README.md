# whatsapp-gpt
* You'll need to run WhatsApp from a phone number using the golang library I'm using.
* You'll run a dedicated browser in another window that's controlling ChatGPT.
* Two terminals: `go run main.go`, and `python server.py`. I am extremely doubtful they will work for you on the first run.
* This marks the end of the readme file; it is a bit sparse; thankfully the code is too! Just tuck in if you can... and I will try to add more here later.

## Get Started

1. Install Requirements (suggest to do it in `virtualenv` or `conda`)

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

2. Launch Terminal 1: `go run main.go`

3. Launch Terminal 2: `python server.py`
